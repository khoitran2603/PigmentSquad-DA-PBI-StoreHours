# Pigment Squad – Store Hours Optimisation (Jan–Jul 2025)

### About the Project
This project investigates Pigment Squad’s trading hours and staffing patterns to answer a key operational question:  
**How can the business reduce staff costs without risking meaningful sales loss?**

The work builds on structured POS transaction data processed through the SQL-based ETL pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers), with insights delivered through Power BI dashboards.

## Key Insights

### 1. Sales Performance
From January to July 2025, the store generated **$195k from 9,000 transactions**, with an average spend of about **$22 per customer**.  
Sales peaked in **January and April (~$37k each)** and again in **July (~$29k)**, closely aligning with **school holidays and public events**.

### 2. Day & Hour Patterns
Customer activity is **heavily weekend-driven**.  
- Saturdays deliver more than **double the weekday** and 1.5× higher than Friday or Sunday.  
- Peak demand occurs at **2pm alone (15% of all transactions)**, while the 1–4pm block contributes nearly **40% of sales**.

### 3. Product Mix
The store’s core business remains **unpainted figurines (70% of transactions)**.  
However, the varnish (Service) upgrade is chosen by only **one in three customers**, largely due to the slow manual process using hand-dryers.  
Investing in faster varnish equipment could raise uptake, improving both customer experience and transaction value.

### 4. Store Hours Efficiency
Most sales happen in the **prime window of 12–5pm**, especially Fridays and weekends.

  <br />

</p>

“Edge hours” also matter:  
- **Before close (Fri–Sat evenings)** and **after open (Sat–Sun mornings)** show healthy activity.
- In contrast, **weekday mornings** and **late nights Mon–Thurs** are consistently underperforming. These are the safest candidates for cost-saving cuts.

## What-If Scenarios (Jan–Jul 2025)

To test how staffing adjustments could reduce costs without hurting revenue, three scenarios were modelled.  
All scenarios assume one staff member per day, with extra Saturday support, across 30 weeks.

- **Baseline:** 72 hrs/week, Staff cost **$79.8k**, Outside-hours sales **$480**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Scenario 1 – Open Later, Close Earlier</strong><br /><br />
      By shifting the opening one hour later (Mon–Fri) and closing one hour earlier (Sun–Thurs), 
      total weekly hours fall to <strong>62</strong>. <br /><br />
      Staff cost drops to <strong>$69,300</strong>, but this reduction in trading hours is estimated 
      to cut about <strong>$7,800 of sales</strong>. <br /><br />
      Net effect: a modest saving of <strong>$2,700 (~$380/month)</strong>.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Scenario 2 – Reduce Staff Hours (Store Hours Unchanged)</strong><br /><br />
      The store remains open full hours, but paid staff hours are capped at <strong>62 per week</strong>. <br /><br />
      Staff cost falls to <strong>$69,300</strong>, with <strong>no sales loss</strong>, as the business owner 
      covers one unpaid hour before opening and after closing. <br /><br />
      This delivers the <strong>largest saving of $10,500 (~$1,500/month)</strong>.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Scenario 3 – Close Earlier on Weekdays</strong><br /><br />
      By closing earlier from Sunday through Thursday, weekly hours reduce to <strong>67</strong>. <br /><br />
      Staff cost lowers to <strong>$74,550</strong>, while sales loss is relatively small (~<strong>$1,700</strong>). <br /><br />
      Net saving: about <strong>$3,550 (~$500/month)</strong>.

## Key Recommendation
1. **Protect Revenue Hours**  
   - Safeguard afternoons (12–5pm), weekends, and Fri–Sat evenings.  
   - These periods consistently deliver the highest sales.  

2. **Trim Low-Value Hours**  
   - Early mornings and Mon–Thurs late evenings are the lowest performers.  
   - Safest areas to shorten hours or reduce staff coverage.  

3. **Leverage Flexible Staffing**  
   - Cap paid staff at ~62 hrs/week to unlock ~$10k annual savings.  
   - Use the owner (or flex shifts) only for marginal edge hours.   

4. **Iterate and Monitor**  
   - Pilot changes for 4–6 weeks.  
   - Track via dashboards to confirm no revenue impact.  
   - Be ready to adjust if demand shifts.
