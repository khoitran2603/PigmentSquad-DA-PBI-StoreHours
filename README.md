# Pigment Squad – Store Hours Optimization (Jan–Jul 2025)

### About the Project
This project analyzes sales and operating patterns for Pigment Squad to answer a critical business question:  
**How can we optimize store hours and staffing to maximize profit while minimizing unnecessary cost?**

The analysis uses structured POS transaction data (SQL-based ETL pipelines, Bronze–Silver–Gold layers) with Power BI dashboards for visualization. Unlike the first project (product classification), this report focuses solely on **time-driven performance** to support operational decisions.

## Key Insights

### 1. Sales Performance
- $195k sales from 9,000 transactions (avg. $22 each).  
- Peaks in Jan, Apr (~$37k) and Jul (~$29k), driven by school holidays.

### 3. Product Mix
- Figurines = 70% of sales.  
- Varnish upsell low (~20% transactions) due to slow manual drying.  
- Investing in faster varnish process = opportunity to raise transaction value.

### 4. Store Hours Efficiency
- Prime window: **12–5pm (esp. Fri–Sun)**.  
- Valuable “edge hours”: Fri–Sat before close, Sat–Sun after open.  
- Low yield: weekday mornings, Mon–Thurs late evenings.

## What-If Scenarios

- **Baseline:** 72 hrs/week, Staff cost $79.8k, Outside-hours sales $480.

- **Scenario 1 (Shorter Hours):** Save $2.7k but lose ~$7.8k sales.  
- **Scenario 2 (Staff Cut, No Hour Change):** Save **$10.5k**, no sales loss ✅.  
- **Scenario 3 (Close Earlier Sun–Thurs):** Save $3.5k, lose ~$1.7k sales.

## Recommendation
1. **Protect Revenue Hours**  
   - Keep core trading hours intact: **12–5pm, weekends, and Fri–Sat evenings.**  
   - Cutting these hours risks meaningful sales loss.  

2. **Trim Low-Value Hours**  
   - Early mornings and Mon–Thurs late evenings consistently underperform.  
   - These are the safest areas to reduce staff coverage or shorten operating hours.  

3. **Leverage Flexible Staffing**  
   - Cap weekly paid staff hours (~62 hrs/week) to unlock ~$10k annual savings.  
   - Use the business owner (or flexible staff shifts) to cover edge hours where sales are minimal but presence is still required.  

4. **Iterate and Monitor**  
   - Trial adjustments for 4–6 weeks.  
   - Use dashboards (heatmaps + scenario tracking) to confirm no significant sales loss.  
   - Adjust staffing mix if demand shifts.
